# FreeSwap Decentralized Exchange Protocol
<br/>

**FreeSwap** protocol is a decentralized exchange protocol that does not charge any exchange fees at all.

**FreeSwap** exchange protocol is based on the "constant-product invariant" formula, which creates two one-way liquidity pools for each pair of tokens.

As the exchange going on, the token price within the two liquidity pools will deviate more and more. While the token price difference reaches the preset threshold, the two sub-pools will conduct arbitrage with each other automatically. This arbitrage can smooth the token price difference of the two liquidity pools, and also make profits for the liquidity providers.

Calculation shows that, if arbitrage is executed while the two sub-pool price deviation is **1%**, **FreeSwap** protocol can make an arbitrage profit equivalent to charging **2.488‰** exchange fees.

If the arbitrage threshold is set to **1.21%**, arbitrage profit could be at same level as of **3‰** charged by **UniSwap** for token exchange.
